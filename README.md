Ok how is this different?
- This implementation is modular using ES6
- the helper methods are separated from the main logic
- it works both with scroll wheel and with magic mouse on macos or trackpad 


The project is using prepros which is free https://prepros.io/ \
Prepros is used for bundling, minifying, transforming scss and js and for live reload.

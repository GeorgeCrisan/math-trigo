This project has been made following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK3vKWMFVgw which is a video made by
Radu Mariescu-Istodor at https://www.youtube.com/@Radu. Credit to him.

Ok, how is this different from the original tutorial?
- it works with scroll wheel mouse and with magic mouse on macos or trackpad (even up and down arrow keys)
- This implementation is modular and using ES6/ES7
- the helper methods are separated from the main logic
- the code is commented and the main logic is short
- There are two entries, index.html for the first part of the tutorial and full-circle.html for the second part.
  index.js is for the first part and index-circle.js use for second part, both files sharing the same helpers (helpers.js file)  
- Circle implementation has an input that allows you to type numeric values for Theta

The project is using prepros which is free https://prepros.io/ \
